This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Understand the history of Node-RED and why you need to learn a flow-based programming tool
* Use Node-RED for building Node.js-based applications
* Handle data for IoT devices using Node-RED flows
* Explore advanced Node-RED features such as connecting repositories and customizing the flow editor
* Find out what the MQTT protocol is and how it relates to Node-RED

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter04.

The code will look like the following:
```
// generate random number
var min = 1 ;
var max = 10 ;
var a = Math.floor( Math.random() * (max + 1 - min) ) + min ;
// set random number to message
msg.payload = a;
// return message
return msg;

```
