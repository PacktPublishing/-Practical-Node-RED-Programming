# node-red-contrib-<Any specified string>

## Overview
This node is a node for forcibly converting all the alphabet character strings passed as input to the character string "Taipon rock".

Even if the input parameter passed is not a character string, "Taiponrock" is forcibly returned.

In this process, it is a wonderful node that changed the sample node that was executing toLowerCase, which is an instance method of String object in JavaScript, to a process that just returns a meaningless constant.


## how to use
It is used when you want to forcibly convert all the character strings of the parameters to be passed to "Taiponrock".
